Soft skills, such as communication, decision-making, collaboration, teamwork, time management, creativity, etc., are the more transferable abilities of a candidate. It is much more challenging to screen for soft skills because, in contrast to hard skills, they are harder to quantify. Consequently, two tests are included in this assessment to evaluate soft skills. They consist of Memory and Reactions.

One of the new soft skills for daily tasks is memory. Maybe your staff members could profit from Bookboon's efficient memory-boosting solution if they frequently forget steps in difficult tasks or simply forget to complete them?

Stress at work can have repercussions, as is well known. Memory loss is one of these effects. There are things we can do to combat stress and, in some cases, a heavy workload.

However, memory issues are not just a result of stress. Memory is a regular problem for people who experience learning challenges like dyslexia. Employers can support everyone in managing memory problems.

You must deliver an outstanding customer experience in today's fiercely competitive market.

There are now a huge number of suppliers for almost any good or service. The level of customer service is the key competitive differentiator in a market where customers have a plethora of brands vying for their business every day.

Modern consumers have high standards; they demand prompt, excellent service. The length of your average response time has a direct bearing on your conversion rates, reputation, and customer satisfaction.

In order to allow users to test their accuracy, speed in responses and memory, this assessment includes these two crucial soft skills.

 *Steps to set up the project:*
      1. Clone the repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. You can do this by opening your terminal or command prompt and running the following 
git clone [repository link](https://github.com/tejanarayana05/assignment-teja.git)

      2. Install dependencies: Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the repository directory using the terminal or command prompt and install the dependencies required by the app using the npm or yarn package manager. Run one of the following commands depending on your package manager:

                        npm install
                            or
                        yarn install
    This will install all the dependencies required to run the app.

      3. Start the development server: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:

                         npm start
                            or
                        yarn start
This will start the development server and open your app in a new browser window. You can now start editing your React code and see the changes in real-time.

      4. Customize the app: Once the app is running, you can customize it according to your needs. You can modify the code, add new components, or install additional dependencies using the npm or yarn package manager.

      5. Build the app for production: Once you are done with the customization, you can build the app for production using the following command:

                     npm run build
                          or
                      yarn build
This will create a production-ready build of your app in the build directory. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
